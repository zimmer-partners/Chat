# Chat – AI and Conversational Siri for iPhones, iPads and Macs without Apple Intelligence Support

## What's It

Chat is a set of Shortcuts adding system wide access to an AI Chat on Apple devices missing support for Apple Intelligence and Conversational Siri requests. By leveraging the Perplexity API it's super cost efficient; you can run months for a few dollars without a Pro account needed. Both "Chat" and "Conversation" need "Chat Encoder" to run.

Chat provides integration as a Lock Screen Widget, Control Center Action and can be added to the Home Screen. Its user interface of Chat does not block any further processes on the device and request are processed in the background.

Conversation is optimized for voice input and should be triggered through Siri. You can rename it to any trigger word you like, note however to use something unique for Siri to not trigger unintended actions. Conversation can be used on AirPods, Home Pods and Apple Watches.

Chat comes with translations for English and German. If you want to contribute other languages, feel free to contact Moritz.
